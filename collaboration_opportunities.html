<h1>Collaboration Opportunities</h1>
<p><b>【Large Language Models】</b> We have collected various financial text datasets, and trained the Llama2 by ourselves. It's a model which can competes with GPT4. We can help you conquer different NLP tasks, and then send the structured data to you. What's more, we can also help you build your own large language models (with code in your own hand, and help you deploy it in your company. Let's make things possible together!)</p>
<br></br>

<p><b>【Wealth Management】</b> We can help you do solid research on different asset products. And then do portfolio optimizations by our SEAL, a special team which has several part-time Tsinghua PhDs, specialized in putting operation research into the use of financial problems.</p>
<br></br>


<p><b>【Alpha Factors & Index】</b>We can try to minning alpha factors as your requirement. Also, we can construct amazing beta index products. Such as alpha cloning the inventory of Blackrock and Vanguard, and then combine it with value factors. Or using news text data to find the most hot topics, rank it and construct some beta products. </p>

<p>We are also glad to hear charming ideas from you, and provide you with tailored research service.</p>
